String differences
	char* hi = "abcde";
		if you try to do hi[0] = q; you will get a protected variable violation

	char[] hi = "abcde";
		This will not cause the violation and is fine, no number is also needed within the brackets too.

String creation
	char[6] hi;
	(void) strcpy(hi,"Hello");
		Need an additonal byte for the null terminator

Cannot get array length, but can get strlength ... check "man 3 string"

Some useful make commands
	cat -t Makefile
		displays TABS, so you can see if you've messed up
	egrep '\[] $' Makefile
		Displays lines that have a space after \
Debugging
	gdb, compile gcc with -g flag, and run gdb "the runnable file"
		list <line> prints out a view of the code
Assert
	Asserts only work when compiling in debug mode

Exec
	Unload the current program that ran exec, and replace it with the program you ran exec on.
argv
	argv is a vaibale-length, NULL terminated "vector" of strings (char *).

extern keyword
	need to look over

SOCKET
	#include <sys/socket.h>

	int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
		domain - type of domain
		type - type of domain
		protocol - tpye of protocol, using a 0 causes socket to use an unspecified default protocol for the requested socket type

		Domain
			AF_INET (IPv4)
			AF_INET6 (IPv6)

		TYPE
			SOCK_STREAM (TCP) GOOD
				Provides sequenced, reliable, bidirectional, connection-mode byte streams, and may provide a transmission mechanism for out-of-band data.
			SOCK_DGRAM (UDP) MEH
				Provides datagrams, which are connectionless-mode, unreliable messages of fixed maximum length.
			SOCK_SEQPACKET
				Provides sequenced, reliable, bidirectional, connection-mode transmission paths for records. A record can be sent using one or more output operations and received using one or more input operations, but a single operation never transfers part of more than one record. Record boundaries are visible to the receiver via the MSG_EOR flag.

			Return vals
				Upon successful completion, socket() shall return a non-negative integer, the socket file descriptor. Otherwise, a value of -1 shall be returned and errno set to indicate the error.

	Dont forget about big and little edian, and figure out which youre using. Flip respectivley
