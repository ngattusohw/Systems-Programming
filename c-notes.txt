String differences
	char* hi = "abcde";
		if you try to do hi[0] = q; you will get a protected variable violation

	char[] hi = "abcde";
		This will not cause the violation and is fine, no number is also needed within the brackets too.

String creation
	char[6] hi;
	(void) strcpy(hi,"Hello");
		Need an additonal byte for the null terminator

Cannot get array length, but can get strlength ... check "man 3 string"
