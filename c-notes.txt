String differences
	char* hi = "abcde";
		if you try to do hi[0] = q; you will get a protected variable violation

	char[] hi = "abcde";
		This will not cause the violation and is fine, no number is also needed within the brackets too.

String creation
	char[6] hi;
	(void) strcpy(hi,"Hello");
		Need an additonal byte for the null terminator

Cannot get array length, but can get strlength ... check "man 3 string"

Some useful make commands
	cat -t Makefile
		displays TABS, so you can see if you've messed up
	egrep '\[] $' Makefile
		Displays lines that have a space after \
Debugging
	gdb, compile gcc with -g flag, and run gdb "the runnable file"
		list <line> prints out a view of the code
Assert
	Asserts only work when compiling in debug mode

Exec
	Unload the current program that ran exec, and replace it with the program you ran exec on.
argv
	argv is a vaibale-length, NULL terminated "vector" of strings (char *).
